# werewolf
I'm having fun simulating the party game Werewolf.

For almost 10 years, I've enjoyed playing *Werewolf*. It's a party game, similar to *Mafia*, where you have a group of people and a couple of them are werewolves and they "kill" someone each night and then you all vote to "kill" one of them. It's fun. Anyway, now that I have some R skills, I thought I'd try to simiulate the game. It's been a fun little project.
